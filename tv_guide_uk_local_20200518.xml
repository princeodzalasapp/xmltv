As usual, all participants will be hoping to deceive one another with plausible lies, such as Richard stating he has never seen Breaking Bad because of his Homes Under the Hammer addiction, Sir Tom claiming he enjoys whiskey on his Christmas morning cornflakes, and Chris explaining that his full name is actually Christmas Kamara. The team also presents a somewhat unusual take on the Nativity.</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Tony Robinson travels along the north Norfolk coast through one of the least developed spots in Britain, finding out how the area maintained its rural, remote identity despite the dynamic industrial changes of the Victorian age. From the arrival of Bertie, Prince of Wales at Sandringham House to the opening of Cromer Pier, Tony's four-day walk sees him learn about key periods in the county's history. He explores prime shooting estates, purpose-built seaside resorts, salt marshes and disused railway lines as he discovers how powerful landowners were able to control development and even shape the railways to suit their needs.</desc>

    <sub-title lang="en">Walking Through History: Bronte Country</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">Tony Robinson embarks on another expedition through some of Britain's most historic landscapes. The moors and valleys of West Yorkshire were the home of, and inspiration for, the Brontes, the literary family who produced such classics as Wuthering Heights and Jane Eyre. Over four days, Tony heads out from the Victorian wool capital of Bradford and treks in a giant loop around what is now known as Bronte Country. From the birth of Charlotte, Emily, Anne and their brother Branwell in the suburb of Thornton, he traces their childhoods to the much-romanticised Bronte hub of Haworth, finding that the harsh reality of life in the 1820s was far removed from the fantasy world dreamed up by the children at their father's parsonage home.</desc>

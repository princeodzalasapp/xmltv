At two key moments, the prime minister's strategic sense helped avert disaster, and in both decisions, the influence of the Duke of Marlborough is apparent. Starkey argues that it was Winston's ability to control events by giving them a narrative meaning that enabled him to shape world history long after his fall from power.</desc>

    <sub-title lang="en">Walking Through History: Bronte Country</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">Tony Robinson embarks on another expedition through some of Britain's most historic landscapes. The moors and valleys of West Yorkshire were the home of, and inspiration for, the Brontes, the literary family who produced such classics as Wuthering Heights and Jane Eyre. Over four days, Tony heads out from the Victorian wool capital of Bradford and treks in a giant loop around what is now known as Bronte Country. From the birth of Charlotte, Emily, Anne and their brother Branwell in the suburb of Thornton, he traces their childhoods to the much-romanticised Bronte hub of Haworth, finding that the harsh reality of life in the 1820s was far removed from the fantasy world dreamed up by the children at their father's parsonage home.</desc>

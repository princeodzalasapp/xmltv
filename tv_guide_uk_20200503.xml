In the first edition, he looks at its formation in the heat of the north African desert in 1941, when eccentric young British army officer David Archibald Stirling had a vision for a new kind of war in which the enemy was attacked from behind their own lines.</desc>

The historian also reveals how many SAS members were captured by the Germans - and hears the extraordinary story of two of them who outran their pursuers by surviving for three days in the desert without food or fresh water.</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Ben Macintyre concludes his history of formation of the British Army special forces unit. With David Stirling locked away in Hitler's most secure prison Colditz, the leadership of the SAS passed to Paddy Mayne, a man who built his reputation on the battlefield as a warrior of the first rank. In 1943, the SAS leaves the desert for Europe to enter a darker and far more complex theatre of war, where they face the threat of execution and the trauma of civilian casualties, as well as being the first to witness the nightmare of Bergen-Belsen concentration camp.</desc>
